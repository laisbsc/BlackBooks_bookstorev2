Ideally, you would want your front end to operate as a standalone application, requesting data from the back end, processing, and displaying it (you might hear this called “consuming an API”). The principle underpinning this is referred to as “separation of concerns”, and it states that each part of your program should operate independently, have a clear, singular purpose, and communicate via a well-defined interface. Although your front end doesn’t have to implement a framework to follow the separation of concerns principle, most frameworks encourage this architectural pattern.
